It's expensive retrieving data from a database, as such it's important to only ask for the rows you require when getting data.
Entity Framework nicely translates the various filters like the Where method into SQL WHERE clauses. This makes it really easy to write nice readable code that is also very efficient.

```csharp
List<Sale> sales = context.Sales.ToList();
foreach (var sale in sales)
{
    if (sale.ProductId == request.ProductId)
    {
        // Do stuff
    }
}
```

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={{
  preset: "badExample",
  figure: 'Bad example - Retrieved all the data instead of items that matched the product id.',
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


```csharp
List<Sale> sales = context.Sales
      .Where(sale => sale.ProductId == Request.ProductId)
      .ToList();

foreach (var sale in sales)
{
    // Do stuff
}
```

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={{
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: 'Good example - Only the data required was retrieved from the database',
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />
