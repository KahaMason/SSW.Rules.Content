Nobody Likes a Slow Website. You should optimize the performance of your websites so it loads as quick as possible.
You should use [Pingdom Website Speed Test](http://tools.pingdom.com/fpt/) to analyze the load speed of your websites and learn how to make them faster.

Then work to keep it under 3 MB:

* **Unacceptable** &gt;
  **3 MB**
* OK  **1.5 MB** to
  **3 MB**  (apple.com is 1.5MB)
* Good &lt;
  **1.5 MB**
* **Excellent** &lt;
  **1 MB**
